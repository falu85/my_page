            Having practiced as a pediatric nurse for 10+ years, my original goal was to remain in clinical practice.
            However, being someone who questions and wants to learn more, created a growing interest in the technology
            that helped us care for our patients. This, encouraged me to obtain a degree in Computer Science.<br /><br />My
            professional work experience has helped me develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, the
            ability to work well independently and within a team, as well as the ability to assess and prioritize based
            on continuously changing information. <br /><br />When not working on portfolio projects, you can find me at
            the climbing gym, martial arts gym, cycling, playing guitar, or learning a new craft. Right now, I am
            learning how to bind books. I also enjoy woodworking, and recently finished a greenhouse build in our back
            yard!

            Working on a website that acts as a repository of all movies currently in theatre in the city of Calgary.
            Movie fans only need to access this one website to see not just the movies playing, but all related movie
            information, theatres they are playing at, and related show times.
