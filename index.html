            Having practiced as a pediatric nurse for 10+ years, my original goal was to remain in clinical practice.
            However, being someone who questions and wants to learn more, created a growing interest in the technology
            that helped us care for our patients. This, encouraged me to obtain a degree in Computer Science.

            My professional work experience has helped me develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, the
            ability to work well independently and within a team, as well as the ability to assess and prioritize based
            on continuously changing information. <br />
            <br />
            When not working on portfolio projects, you can find me at the climbing gym, martial arts gym, cycling,
            playing guitar, or learning a new craft. Right now, I am learning how to bind books. I also enjoy
            woodworking, and recently finished a greenhouse build in our back yard!
