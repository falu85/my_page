    <p class="having-practiced-as">
        Having practiced as a pediatric nurse for 10+ years, my original goal was to remain in clinical practice.
        However, being someone who questions and wants to learn more, created a growing interest in the technology
        that helped us care for our patients. This, encouraged me to obtain a degree in Computer Science.<br /><br />My
        professional work experience has helped me develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, the
        ability to work well independently and within a team, as well as the ability to assess and prioritize based
        on continuously changing information.
