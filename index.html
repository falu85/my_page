            My experience ranges from writing software documentaion, and testing firmware and hardware using a bed-of-nails. Tests were written in 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Python</span> 
            with necessary firmware written in 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">C</span>.
            test fixture to writing 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">CSS and HTML</span>.
            <br><br>
            I created a web user interface (written in 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Svelte</span> 
            with a 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Rust</span> 
            backend) to sort and visualize IoT data with an interactive Google Map interface to search active IoT devices. This also included 
            implementing new features and bug fixes to the IoT firmware.<br><br>
            I also designed a scalable PostgreSQL (implemented using 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Postgres</span>
            ) database to receive and store data from remote LTE connected devices. I then developed scripts in 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">SQL</span> 
            and 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Rust</span> to benchmark 
            the database response time when querying against 1.5 million records.<br><br>
            I wrote a web log-in in Rust using the 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Axum Framework</span> 
            for potential customers to use. I also employed 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">Keycloak</span> 
            and 
            <span class="text-bold text-underline">OpenID Connect (OAuth2)</span>.
