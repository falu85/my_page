                    What conclusions can we draw about the social discourse of the pandemic from words used in tweets?

                <li>
                    How did people react emotionally to various developments such as vaccinations, masks, and COVID developments?

                <li>
                    How did the discussions about COVID evolve as the pandemic progressed?

        <h3>Why We Care:</h3>

            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    To gain a deeper understanding of what topics were important to people during the pandemic

        <h3>What We Did:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    Looked at the influence and sentiments of chosen pandemic keywords: Mask, Doctor,
                    Lockdown, Restriction, School, and Freedom
                </li>
                <li>
                    And countries: China, UK, Canada, Italy, and India
                </li>
                
            </ul>

        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    Mined one year's worth of tweets (~40 Gigabytes) from the Twitter API
                </li>
                <li>
                    Filtered the results based on the keywords mentioned above
                </li>
                <li>
                    Performed sentiment analysis using
                    <span class="text-bold text-underline">NLTK Natural Language Tool Kit</span> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked with my team to implement software to analyze the collected data, and visualize
                    the network using Gephi and NetworkX
                    <span class="text-bold text-underline">Network Analysis in Python</span> 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    The social discourse cannot be summed up in one sentence.
                    Through sentiment analysis we can see that there was a general discontent with governments at that time. 
                    There were also evolving thought patterns on some of the keywords we focused on - for example: the overall
                    sentiment for vaccine began very negative in January 2020, but ended positively in December 2020.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The discussions evolved in multiple ways. It appears as though it was dependent on different aspects of 
                    what and who was involved in the pandemic. For example, a general distaste for the Government, as well as certain 
                    countries, and a sort of flip-flop of sentiment towards things like Vaccine, Masks, Lockdown and Restriction
                </li>
