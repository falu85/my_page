        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    Create a workout application where you can select exercises by searching from an existing list or create new ones
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add these selected exercises to your current workout along with the completed sets and repitions
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Why We Care:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    This area was a great interest for the majority of the team
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the history of the class, all groups who attempted this workout application did not perfom well.
                    We took it as a challenge to be the group to break this pattern
                <li>
                    At the time there was no suitable application for users to have a positive experience
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    Performed extensive information gathering from interviews of potential application users
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collaborated on general User Interface (UI) design and functionality
                <li>
                    Iterated through many UI designs and made changes based on TA and peer feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed an implemented the exercise search and input pages using 
                    <span class="text-bold text-underline">Blazor</span> and 
                    <span class="text-bold text-underline">CSS</span>, 
                    designed application logo and button selections using 
                    <span class="text-bold text-underline">Canva</span> 
                    and hand-drawn art respectively
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed a page to track your workout history, with alerts for new personal bests, as well as a graphical
                    representation of each workout to track improvements
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p class="body">
            <ul class="bullet-point">
                <li>
                    Our group was the first group to break the pattern and obtained a B+ on this project
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ended up also including a tracker of user workouts and alerts for new personal bests!
                </li>
